# spotify-ai-agent-playlist-curator
Create Spotify playlists just by describing what you feel or imagine. This project uses OpenAI and the Spotify Web API to interpret natural language prompts (like “songs about money” or “guitar instrumentals under 3 minutes”) and automatically build playlists that match your vibe.
